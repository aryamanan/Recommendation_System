# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview

This repository contains code and data for building a movie recommendation system. I designed the system to recommend movies based on user preferences and movie attributes. In this README, I will provide an overview of the data preprocessing steps and the structure of the code.

## Data

The data used in this project consists of two main datasets: `credits.csv` and `movies.csv`. Here is some basic information about these datasets:

- `credits.csv`: Contains information about the cast and crew of each movie.
  - Shape: (4803, 4)
  - Columns: 'movie_id', 'title', 'cast', 'crew'

- `movies.csv`: Contains information about movies, including titles, overviews, genres, keywords, and original language.
  - Shape: (4803, 20)
  - Columns: 'movie_id', 'title', 'overview', 'genres', 'keywords', 'cast', 'crew', and more.

### Data Preprocessing

I performed several preprocessing steps on the data to prepare it for building the recommendation system. Here are the key preprocessing steps:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: I removed rows with missing values in the 'overview' column.

2. **Data Cleaning**: I cleaned the text data in the 'overview' column by removing punctuation and converting text to lowercase.

3. **Feature Engineering**: I extracted relevant features from the data, such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew, and transformed them into tags.

4. **Tag Generation**: Tags were generated by combining information from different columns, such as the movie overview, genres, cast, crew, and keywords.

5. **Tag Normalization**: All tags were converted to lowercase for consistency.
